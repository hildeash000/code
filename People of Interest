Victor Vasarely. What to say beside he is awsome at first i was confuse on who he was but i have 
seen is art before on social media when i looked he up i start to know some of his art work 
So of his art hurts my eyes but i think his art work is inspiration to me many people problemly 
not back than but him being known as the father of the Op Art movement is cool.
